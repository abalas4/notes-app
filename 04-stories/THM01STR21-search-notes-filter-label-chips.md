[MOBILE STORY] THM01STR21 — Search notes and filter by label chips
Tags: [Mobile] [Android] [Functional]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Parent Feature  : THM01FTR10
Component       : mobile/jot
Persona         : As the owner on Android
Goal            : I want to search my notes by a word and filter them with label chips
Benefit         : So that I find any note in a few seconds

Platform        : Android <minimum API set in the HLD, step 1.7>+
Counterpart     : none — iOS is Later (Epic Surfaces; REL-1.1)
Device classes  : Small phone | Large phone; portrait
UX Spec         : 06-design/ux/THM01FTR10/ux-spec.md — pending (step 1.6); source screens W1 Home
Fidelity        : High-fidelity mockup (Jot design canvas) — confirmed against 08-ux-design.md §2 at step 1.6
Style Guide     : v1.1 incl. SG-15 — pending approval (step 1.6a)
Usability Check : Proposed "Not required — single-user app; the owner is the Product Owner" (PO decides at 1.6)

Screen / flow:
  Layout        : Search field in the app bar; label chip row (All, my labels, + Label)
  Key Elements  : Search field with clear; chips
  States        : Default | Searching | No results ("No notes match") | Error (Retry) | Offline
  Navigation    : Home; "+ Label" chip opens the label picker in filter mode
Device behaviour:
  Offline       : Online-only (D-07): offline banner; actions that need the API are disabled or fail visibly with Retry; nothing is shown as saved until the API confirms
  Permissions   : None
  Push          : None
  Lifecycle     : Process death or app switch restores the current screen and any unsaved text
  Data on device: No note data at rest beyond the in-memory cache; nothing persisted (op-sqlite deferred with L-01); cleared on sign-out
  Accessibility : TalkBack labels on every control; font scale 200 % reflows; touch targets ≥ 48 dp; reduced motion respected
  Privacy       : None — no data collection change; no store listing (C-05)

Acceptance Criteria:
  AC-01: Given notes, When the owner types "lemon", Then matching notes are shown within 1 s of the last
         keystroke, and clearing the field restores the full list
  AC-02: Given notes, When the owner types a word that matches none, Then "No notes match" is shown
  AC-03: Given label chips, When the owner taps Work, Then only Work notes are shown, and All clears the
         filter
  AC-04: Given the search request fails or there is no network, When the owner searches, Then an error or
         offline message with Retry is shown and no result is presented as current
