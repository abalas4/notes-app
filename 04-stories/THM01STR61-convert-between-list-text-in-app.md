[MOBILE STORY] THM01STR61 — Convert between list and text in the app
Tags: [Mobile] [Android] [Functional]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Parent Feature  : THM01FTR03
Component       : mobile/jot
Persona         : As the owner on Android
Goal            : I want to convert a checklist to a text note and back from the editor
Benefit         : So that I can change a note's form when it suits

Platform        : Android <minimum API set in the HLD, step 1.7>+
Counterpart     : none — iOS is Later (Epic Surfaces; REL-1.1)
Device classes  : Small phone | Large phone; portrait
UX Spec         : 06-design/ux/THM01FTR03/ux-spec.md — pending (step 1.6); source screens W4 Note, W5 List
Fidelity        : High-fidelity mockup (Jot design canvas) — confirmed against 08-ux-design.md §2 at step 1.6
Style Guide     : v1.1 incl. SG-15 — pending approval (step 1.6a)
Usability Check : Proposed "Not required — single-user app; the owner is the Product Owner" (PO decides at 1.6)

Screen / flow:
  Layout        : Editor "more" menu entry; confirmation dialog for list → text
  Key Elements  : Convert to text / Convert to list; confirmation
  States        : Default | Converting | Error (Retry) | Offline
  Navigation    : Editor "more" menu
Device behaviour:
  Offline       : Online-only (D-07): offline banner; actions that need the API are disabled or fail visibly with Retry; nothing is shown as saved until the API confirms
  Permissions   : None
  Push          : None
  Lifecycle     : Process death or app switch restores the current screen and any unsaved text
  Data on device: No note data at rest beyond the in-memory cache; nothing persisted (op-sqlite deferred with L-01); cleared on sign-out
  Accessibility : TalkBack labels on every control; font scale 200 % reflows; touch targets ≥ 48 dp; reduced motion respected
  Privacy       : None — no data collection change; no store listing (C-05)

Acceptance Criteria:
  AC-01: Given a list with checked items, When the owner chooses Convert to text and confirms that checked
         state will be dropped, Then the editor shows a text note with one line per item; When they cancel,
         nothing changes
  AC-02: Given a text note with 3 non-empty lines and 1 blank line, When the owner chooses Convert to list,
         Then the editor shows 3 unchecked items in the original order
  AC-03: Given the convert call fails or there is no network, When the owner converts, Then the note keeps
         its form and an error / offline message with Retry is shown

Story Points    : 2
