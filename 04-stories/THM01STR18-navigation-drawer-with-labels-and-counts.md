[MOBILE STORY] THM01STR18 — Navigation drawer with labels and counts
Tags: [Mobile] [Android] [Functional]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Parent Feature  : THM01FTR04
Component       : mobile/jot
Persona         : As the owner on Android
Goal            : I want a navigation drawer with Notes, Reminders, my labels with counts, Archive and Settings
Benefit         : So that I can reach any group of notes in two taps

Platform        : Android <minimum API set in the HLD, step 1.7>+
Counterpart     : none — iOS is Later (Epic Surfaces; REL-1.1)
Device classes  : Small phone | Large phone; portrait
UX Spec         : 06-design/ux/THM01FTR04/ux-spec.md — pending (step 1.6); source screens W7 Navigation drawer
Fidelity        : High-fidelity mockup (Jot design canvas) — confirmed against 08-ux-design.md §2 at step 1.6
Style Guide     : v1.1 incl. SG-15 — pending approval (step 1.6a)
Usability Check : Proposed "Not required — single-user app; the owner is the Product Owner" (PO decides at 1.6)

Screen / flow:
  Layout        : Drawer: app name; Notes (count); Reminders (count); Labels section with counts; Create new label; Edit labels; Archive; Settings
  Key Elements  : Drawer items with counts; active item highlight
  States        : Default | Loading counts | Error (counts hidden, items still usable) | Offline
  Navigation    : Hamburger on Home; system back closes the drawer; label item → Home filtered by that label
Device behaviour:
  Offline       : Online-only (D-07): offline banner; actions that need the API are disabled or fail visibly with Retry; nothing is shown as saved until the API confirms
  Permissions   : None
  Push          : None
  Lifecycle     : Process death or app switch restores the current screen and any unsaved text
  Data on device: No note data at rest beyond the in-memory cache; nothing persisted (op-sqlite deferred with L-01); cleared on sign-out
  Accessibility : TalkBack labels on every control; font scale 200 % reflows; touch targets ≥ 48 dp; reduced motion respected
  Privacy       : None — no data collection change; no store listing (C-05)

Acceptance Criteria:
  AC-01: Given labels exist, When the owner opens the drawer, Then each label shows its note count and
         Notes / Reminders show their counts
  AC-02: Given the drawer, When the owner taps a label, Then Home shows only notes with that label and the
         count equals the cards shown
  AC-03: Given TalkBack is on, When the drawer opens, Then focus moves into it and each item reads its name
         and count
