[MOBILE STORY] THM01STR11 — Delete a note with five-second undo
Tags: [Mobile] [Android] [Functional]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Parent Feature  : THM01FTR02
Component       : mobile/jot
Persona         : As the owner on Android
Goal            : I want to delete a note and have 5 seconds to undo it
Benefit         : So that an accidental delete is reversible

Platform        : Android <minimum API set in the HLD, step 1.7>+
Counterpart     : none — iOS is Later (Epic Surfaces; REL-1.1)
Device classes  : Small phone | Large phone; portrait
UX Spec         : 06-design/ux/THM01FTR02/ux-spec.md — pending (step 1.6); source screens W1 Home snackbar
Fidelity        : High-fidelity mockup (Jot design canvas) — confirmed against 08-ux-design.md §2 at step 1.6
Style Guide     : v1.1 incl. SG-15 — pending approval (step 1.6a)
Usability Check : Proposed "Not required — single-user app; the owner is the Product Owner" (PO decides at 1.6)

Screen / flow:
  Layout        : Snackbar at the bottom of Home
  Key Elements  : "Note deleted · Undo" snackbar
  States        : Default | Deleting | Undo available (5 s) | Error (Retry) | Offline
  Navigation    : Delete from the editor "more" menu or the card menu
Device behaviour:
  Offline       : Online-only (D-07): offline banner; actions that need the API are disabled or fail visibly with Retry; nothing is shown as saved until the API confirms
  Permissions   : None
  Push          : None
  Lifecycle     : Process death or app switch restores the current screen and any unsaved text
  Data on device: No note data at rest beyond the in-memory cache; nothing persisted (op-sqlite deferred with L-01); cleared on sign-out
  Accessibility : TalkBack labels on every control; font scale 200 % reflows; touch targets ≥ 48 dp; reduced motion respected
  Privacy       : None — no data collection change; no store listing (C-05)

Acceptance Criteria:
  AC-01: Given a note, When the owner deletes it, Then it disappears and a snackbar offers Undo for 5
         seconds
  AC-02: Given the snackbar is visible, When Undo is tapped, Then the note is restored at its previous
         position in its section (Pinned or Others)
  AC-03: Given the snackbar was shown, When 5 seconds pass without Undo, Then the snackbar closes and the
         note stays gone with no further way to restore it in the MVP (no Trash, decision Q3)
  AC-04: Given the delete call fails or there is no network, When the owner deletes a note, Then the note
         stays visible and an error with Retry is shown
  AC-05: Given Undo is tapped and the restore call fails, When the response returns, Then an error with
         Retry is shown and Retry restores the note while the 30-second server window lasts
